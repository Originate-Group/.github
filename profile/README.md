## About Us

## Our Projects

### Requirements as a Service
**Launching Now** - Intelligent requirements engineering for modern teams

Stop losing weeks in requirement refinement. Our open source toolkit uses AI to help you:

**Key Capabilities:**
- 🎯 Transform conversations into structured requirements
- 🔍 Identify gaps and conflicts automatically
- 📐 Generate test cases and acceptance criteria
- 🔄 Maintain living documentation that evolves with your project
- 🚀 Export to your existing tools (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues)

**Why We Built This:**
After years watching teams struggle with the requirements→code gap, we realized the tooling hasn't kept pace with how teams actually work. We're changing that.

## Philosophy

We believe in:
- **AI as Amplifier** - Intelligent automation that enhances human judgment
- **Requirements First** - Great software starts with clarity
- **Open by Default** - Transparent development, welcoming contributions
- **Ship, Learn, Iterate** - Real-world feedback beats perfection paralysis

## Built By

A father-son collaboration bringing together:
- Enterprise engineering leadership and payment systems expertise
- Modern web development and design sensibility
- A shared belief that AI should amplify human creativity, not replace it

We're building in public because the best tools come from real developer feedback.

## What's Next

🚀 **Now**
- Launching Requirements as a Service v0.1
- Seeking early adopters and feedback

💡 **Q1 2026**
- Integration plugins for Jira, Linear, and GitHub Issues
- AI agent architecture for advanced requirement validation
- Community-driven feature development

📈 **2026 and Beyond**
- Additional tooling and ventures
